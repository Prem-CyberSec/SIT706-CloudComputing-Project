## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following installed on your machine:
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- Node.js and npm (for frontend dependencies, if any)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Prem-CyberSec/SIT706-CloudComputing-Project.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd SIT706-CloudComputing-Project
    ```
3.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    *(You may need to add a `requirements.txt` file)*
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    *(If you have a `package.json` in your frontend directory)*
    ```sh
    cd path/to/frontend
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to run the application. For example:

**To start the backend server:**
```sh
python app.py
```

**To start the frontend application:**
```sh
cd path/to/frontend
npm start
```

Then, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the appropriate port).
